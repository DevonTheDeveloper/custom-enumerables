# Custom Enumerables

## Description
In this project I have to reimplement common enumerables.
# Custom Enumerables
This repository contains my solution to the project in The Odin Project's [Custom Enumerables](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/custom-enumerables) project.

## Methods recreated
* #my_each
* #my_each_with_index
* #my_select
* #my_all?
* #my_any?
* #my_none?
* #my_count
* #my_map
* #my_inject

These methods should work exactly like the Ruby functions.
